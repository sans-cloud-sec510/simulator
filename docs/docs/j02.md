# SANS SEC510 Cloud Security Simulator Setup Guide (J02)

SEC510 students can follow these instructions to build the labs in their personal AWS, Azure, and Google cloud accounts. Doing so allows students to complete the labs after access to the SANS provisioned accounts is expired. Cost estimates vary by cloud provider:

- AWS free tier eligible accounts are expected to cost roughly $10 USD per day for the AWS resources (including the cloud simulator instance). Make sure you stop the cloud simulator instance when you are not using it.

- Azure Pay as You Go (PAYG) subscriptions are expected to cost roughly $5 USD per day for the Azure resources.

- Google Cloud projects are expected to cost roughly $5 USD per day for the Google Cloud resources.

To limit costs, please make sure to run the **Lab 5.4: Tear Down** script in the electronic workbook when you are not using the lab environment.

!!! warning "YOUR Financial Responsibility"

    When running the Cloud Security Flight Simulator and performing the corresponding labs in your personal AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud environments, **YOU** are responsible for all costs.

!!! warning "BEWARE OF SECURITY RISKS"

    We will be deploying purposefully vulnerable applications and infrastructure to these accounts. This is necessary to illustrate the dangers of insecure cloud environments and how to mitigate the risk they introduce.

    While we take precautions to keep students safe, **SANS cannot guarantee that these accounts will be protected.**

    We recommend monitoring your accounts for unexpected activity. You should also consider canceling your billing when you are done with your lab environment. Here are instructions on how to do this:

    - [Close your AWS account](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/close-aws-account/){ target="_blank" rel="noopener" }
    - [Cancel your Azure subscription](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/manage/cancel-azure-subscription){ target="_blank" rel="noopener" }
    - [Shutting down GCP projects](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects#shutting_down_projects){ target="_blank" rel="noopener" }

## Cloud Simulator Deployment

### Requirements

- Details found in Course Materials Downloads "Lab Setup Instructions" guide:
    - Firefox + [SmartProxy (by Salar K)](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/smartproxyextension/){:target="_blank"}
    - SANS Cloud Security [CA Certificate](https://sec510.com/ca){:target="_blank"}
- Provided by you:
    - AWS personal account with administrator credentials
    - [Terraform 1.4](https://www.terraform.io/){:target="_blank"} or later
    - [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/){:target="_blank"}
- Provided by the SEC510 instructor or OnDemand SME:
    - Cloud flight simulator AMI shared to your personal AWS account
    - Commands to set the Terraform variables and apply the template

### Step by Step Instructions

1. Configure your AWS CLI with administrator credentials for your AWS Account.

    ```bash
    aws configure
    ```

- Create a new working directory for running the Terraform deployment.

    ```bash
    mkdir ~/sec510
    cd ~/sec510
    ```

- Download the [sec510-j02.tf](./assets/sec510-j02.tf) launch template (e.g. *sec510-j02.tf*) into the `~/sec510` directory.

- After sharing the AMI with your personal AWS account, the instructor or OnDemand SME will give you the commands to set the required Terraform variables and apply the template. Run those commands in the `~/sec510` directory.

- The `terraform apply` command will take a few minutes to complete. Once it is finished, you will see the following:

    - The `environment_summary` output contains the information you need to connect to the Cloud Security Flight Simulator.

    - *SmartProxy Config* - The name of the SmartProxy configuration file created by Terraform in the `~/sec510` directory.

    - *SSH + SOCKS Connect Command* - The command to connect to the Cloud Security Flight Simulator using SSH and the SOCKS proxy using the private key created by Terraform in the `~/sec510` directory.

    ```plain
    Apply complete! Resources: 16 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.

    Outputs:

    environment_summary = <<END_SUMMARY

    END_SUMMARY
    ```

- Follow the course **Lab Setup Instructions** guide to install the Cloud Security Flight Simulator's CA certificate, configure the SmartProxy extension, and connect to the Cloud Security Flight Simulator.

## AWS Cloud Security IAM User

To deploy the lab infrastructure to AWS, you need to create a new `cloudsecurity` IAM user. The easiest way to set permissions is by attaching the **AdministratorAccess** policy. Our recommendation is to use a permission boundary on this IAM user to restrict access to the services not used in the AWS labs. Then, create a new pair of access keys for authenticating the Cloud Security Flight Simulator to your account.

### Requirements

- Provided by you:
    - AWS personal account with administrator credentials

### Step by Step Instructions

1. Log into the AWS Console using your personal administrator account.

- See the [Creating an IAM user in your AWS account](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users_create.html){:target="_blank"} documentation to create a new `cloudsecurity` user.

- See the [Adding permissions to a user (console)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users_change-permissions.html#users_change_permissions-add-console){:target="_blank"} documentation to attach the `AdministratorAccess` policy.

- See the [Managing access keys for IAM users](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html){:target="_blank"} documentation to create a new pair of access keys for the `cloudsecurity` user.

- Follow the **Lab 1.0 - Lab Setup Instructions** instructions in the electronic workbook to configure the Cloud Security Flight Simulator's AWS Command Line Interface (CLI).

## Azure Subscription

To deploy the lab infrastructure to Azure, you need to create a new Azure Subscription (Pay as you Go) and authenticate the Cloud Security Flight Simulator to your Azure subscription.

### Requirements

- Provided by you:
    - Azure Pay as You Go (PAYG) subscription with owner permissions

### Step by Step Instructions

1. Log into the Azure Portal using your personal administrator account.

- Follow the **Lab 1.0 - Lab Setup Instructions** instructions in the electronic workbook to configure the Cloud Security Flight Simulator's Command Line Interface (CLI) to authenticate to your Azure subscription.

## Google Cloud Project

To deploy the lab infrastructure to Google, you will need to create a new Google Cloud Project and authenticate the Cloud Security Flight Simulator to use the associated Google account.

### Requirements

- Provided by you:
    - Personal Google Cloud project

## Clean Up

- When you are finished with the labs, run the **Lab 5.4: Tear Down** script in the electronic workbook to remove the lab infrastructure from your AWS, Azure and Google cloud accounts.

- Then use the same Terraform commands you used to create the Cloud Security Flight Simulator, except change the last command from `terraform apply` to `terraform destroy`. This will remove the Cloud Security Flight Simulator and the SmartProxy configuration file from your AWS account.
